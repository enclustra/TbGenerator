## Description
This tool automatically creates a testbench skeleton from a DUT VHDL file. Additional settings (e.g. clock frequencies) can be annotated in the VHDL file directly as comments.

The testbench generated can have two forms:

* Single File TB
  * All code in a single file
  * No separate test-cases
* Multi File TB
  * If multiple testcases are specified, a package file is generated for each test-case
  * This allows better organization of large testbenches


For more details, refer to the [documentation](./doc/TbGenerator.pdf)

## Tagging Policy
Stable releases are tagged in the form *major*.*minor*.*bugfix*. 

* Whenever a change is not fully backward compatible, the *major* version number is incremented
* Whenever new features are added, the *minor* version number is incremented
* If only bugs are fixed (i.e. no functional changes are applied), the *bugfix* version is incremented
